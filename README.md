This project uses pipenv to manage its dependencies. Pipenv will enfore a specific python version, but running pipenv install will let you know if you need to update your
python or not when it reads the pipfile. So first you will install some form of python just to get pip and pipenv, you may need to update or downgrade your python from there.
In a little bit I will add more virtualenv stuff so that we actually run a local folder based python as well just to make it even easier.

How to Run:

first install some form of python

then "pip install pipenv"

then "pipenv install" while in the same directory as the clone.

then "pipenv run python Battleship.py"
